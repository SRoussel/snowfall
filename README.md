# snowfall
### by sam roussel

## inspiration
This piece was written in the Maine winter, accompanied by falling snow and steaming tea. It is intentionally sparse and bare, reflecting the austere snowy landscape. Emphasis is placed on descending motifs which fall like flakes, time signatures shifting as the rate of snow changes, soothing, slow melodies, and embellished harmonies (7ths and 9ths) with a clear functional harmony beneath.

## tech
Snowfall was written using [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net), a code-based music creation tool. Sonic Pi uses Ruby within its own interactive IDE. This project used Parallels to run Sonic Pi on Windows 10, as well as iMovie to create the accompanying music video.

## process
I developed the chord progresions and melodies on a keyboard. Much of my time was spent playing around with different sounds and features in Sonic Pi. Using functions and threads was very helpful in organizing my code, playing chords and melodies simultaneously, and reusing recurring motifs.
